      <p class="text">Born in the United States of America, Brendan Eich is known for being the former CEO of Mozilla. More notably, he is known for creating the programming language called JavaScript. One of his greatest accomplishments was building Javascript in 10 days. In 1995, there was a demand for programming languages and Netscape was looking for one. Brendan Eich at 34 years old, spent 10 tiring days coding the language. Brendan did coding languages for fun without being commissioned to do so. JavaScript went by many names. At first, it was called Mocha but it then changed to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. This programming language is known to help add interactivity to a website. The use of JavaScript can be seen everywhere on the internet such as buttons to access all sorts of things.</p>
